== Risks and Technical Debts

We have identified the risk or technical debts we might encounter during the project. They are ordered by priority from higher risk to lower.

.Risks Table
|=========================================================
| Risk | Explanation | Solution 

| Lack of knowledge of SOLID
| It's a new technology, and we have no idea how to work with it. The documentation is lacklester and there are not many examples. Some of the 
| We must do our own research, ask other students and other developers. We need to have a good understanding of the technology first.

| Lack of knowledge of React
| Although we have some knowledge of JavaScript, we are new to React and Node.
| React has very good documentation, so we have to check examples. We have to understand how Node works. This part should be easier to deal with than the previous one.

| Time
| We are limited by the deadlines of the course.
| All we can do is optimize our working time.

| Working on teams
| Working with other people is not always easy, since each one does things its way.
| We have to do regular meetings and try to comment our code, so everyone can understand it and work with it.

.Technical Debts Table
|=========================================================
| Technical Debt | Explanation 

| Host failures
| In case the pod host fails (e.g. Inrupt went down for some minutes while we were testing) the application will be useless. Due to our pod-only design decision this cannot be solved.
