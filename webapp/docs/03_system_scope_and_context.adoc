== System Scope and Context


Our system: Radarin, is aimed to ease the meeting and communication with friends using the new technologies, while respecting user' privacy and confidential data as
close as possible. This is possible due to the decentralized nature of the system, being integrated with SOLID where users will be able to manage their PODs so all
their personal data will be under their control.
Radarin is designed to use users locations and timestamps , so they can get notified of any close friend around them at a given time. Among other functionalities such 
as sending messages to their friends, creating their own maps or sharing media into the system.
