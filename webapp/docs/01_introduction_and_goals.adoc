== Introduction and Goals


The goal of this project is to facilitate meetings between friends using new technologies. The application will use the geolocation of the devices to connect close friends.


The technologies that will be used in this project will be:


* The location provided by the device, if the users voluntarily allow it
* The system will be compatible with the SOLID project.
* All the user's data will be stored on the user's pod, who will be the owner of its own data.
* The application won't have any control over the user's data.
* The user will have control over who can see their location at any time.


=== Requirements Overview


Here we have the functional requirements that our application will provide:


* Users will be able to visualize and manage locations in the web application.
* Users will be able to send their location to the pod and get notified if friends are nearby.
* Users' data will be stored in a completely decentralized way, in their personal pod.
* All the users' information will be queried from the users' pods.
